## Getting Setup:

:beer::beer::beer:

### Dependencies:

- [Node.js / NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Knex](https://knexjs.org)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

From your terminal run:

`$ npm install`
`$ node server.js`

### Get the Repository:

We'd love for you to contribute code to our project! If so, begin by clicking the `Fork` button on Github. Then use `git clone` to copy your fork onto your local machine.

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE/BuildYourOwnBackend`

Go into the newly created directory:

`$ cd BuildYourOwnBackend`

Add an `upstream` remote that points to the main repo:

`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/flevenson/BuildYourOwnBackend`

Fetch the latest version of `master` from `upstream`:

`$ git fetch upstream master`

### Getting it Running:

You need to create a database named: `byobe`:

`$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE byobe"`

Once created, run `$ knex seed:run` to populate the database.

### Test:

To run the test suite, start by creating a test database:

`$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE byobe_test"`

To populate the test database:

`$ knex seed:run --env test`

To run the test suite: 

`$ npm test`
